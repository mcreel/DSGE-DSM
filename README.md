# DSGE-DSM
Estimation of a dsge model using deep simulated moments.

This package uses "deep simulated moments" as proposed in [*Constructing Efficient Simulated Moments Using Temporal Convolutional Networks* by Chassot, J. and Creel, M. (2023)](https://www.jldc.ch/uploads/2023_chassot_creel.pdf) to estimate a simple DSGE model.

"Deep simulated moments" refers to using a temporal convolutional net to fit the parameters of a model using data generated by the model directly as the input to the net. The output of the net is a point estimator of the parameters, with the same dimension. The output is also a vector of statistics, being a transformation of the sample data. This statistic can be used to define an exactly identified method of simulated moments estimator, as in indirect inference, but with exact identification.

## The model is a simple example of a DSGE model:

```julia
equations:
MUC = c^(-γ)
MUL = ψ*exp(η)
r = α * exp(z) * k^(α-1) * n^(1-α)
w = (1-α)*exp(z)* k^α * n^(-α)
MUC = β*MUC(+1) * (1 + r(+1) - δ)
w = MUL/MUC
z(+1) = ρ₁*z + σ₁ * u
η(+1) = ρ₂*η + σ₂ * ϵ
y = exp(z) * (k^α) * (n^(1-α))
k(+1) = y - c + (1-δ)*k
end
```

which is solved and simulated, to give the variables y, c, n, w, and r.

These variables are observed with measurement error.
